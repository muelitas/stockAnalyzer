# stockAnalyzer

Specify custom rules to automatically analyze stocks.

### Ground Truth Gathering

The plan is to create a file that runs every day (initially as a batch file in personal computer; later as a lambda function in AWS) were we download historical data for a given list of stocks and store it locally. If data has already been downloaded for the first time, update it by removing the oldest entry and appending the most recent one (this so that data remains in an x-number-of-years range).

### Ground Truth Processsing

### Ground Truth Analysis

Here is where the magic will happen; data will be analyzed with machine learning algorithm(s), deep learning algorithm(s) and/or common technical indicators such as moving average, bollinger bands, etc.

As a nice to have, email updates might be implemented.

_Note: It seems it trains on all of AAPL's historical data; it seems it uses close prices only; LSTM is more predictable and seems to be better for online (incremental learning); transformers seem like a better option for batch learning; LSTM uses ~10x more params._
