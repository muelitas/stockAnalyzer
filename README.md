### Ground Truth Gathering

The plan is to create a file that runs every day (initially as a batch file in personal computer; later as a lambda function in AWS) were we download historical data for a given list of stocks and store it locally. If data has already been downloaded for the first time, update it by removing the oldest entry and appending the most recent one (this so that data remains in an x-number-of-years range).
